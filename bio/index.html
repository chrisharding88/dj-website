	    		<p>Before there's DJ Chrisain Bolt, there's an average avid music listener named Christopher Harding. Music is his first passion ever since he was a young child when he parents played that Bob Marley "Legend" album. His favorite genres are Hip-Hop, Dancehall, Rock, and EDM. His admiration of music had led him to  become a DJ.</p>
	    		<p>Chris picked up his first DJ controller circa 2009. At first, he was just playing around with it. However, he watched various YouTube videos on DJ skills such as beatmatching, transitioning, cutting, and scratching. After he mastered those, he started out releasing his mixes via Soundcloud. He has gotten well on the plays until Soundcloud deleted his mixes due to copywrite issues. But no worries, you can listen to all of his mixes on Mixcloud.</p>
	    		<p>At 27, he got a notificaition from a friend and asked to play at her trunk party and he accepted it. Later on that time, he played his first gig at a trunk party and it was a success. A year later, he got a text from cousin to spin at a wedding in Minnesota. This is a monumental moment for him. </p>
